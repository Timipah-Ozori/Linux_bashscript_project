# Linux_bashscript_project
The objective of this project is to create a bash script for a multiplication table, applying loops and appliying condition and handling user input. 

This script will prompt users to input a number from which the multiplication table will be generated 

1. I created a file and started my script 
# ![](./img/1.%20This%20is%20to%20prompt%20user%20to%20input%20number%20for%20multiplication%20table.png)

2. This is for the user to select choice of table either full or partial table. 
# ![](./img/2.%20This%20is%20the%20prompt%20for%20user%20to%20select%20a%20full%20or%20partial%20table.png)


3.  This is the first condition passed if user selects a full timetable 
![](./img/3.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20condition%20if%20choice%20of%20table%20is%20Full.png)

![](./img/for%20loop%20list%20form.png)
First using the if statement and conditions.
# Calculating the multiplication table for 5;

4. Using the list form loop, then the output displaying the multiplication table 
![](./img/4.%20Output%20after%20condition%20and%20loop.png)

The next condition is if the choice of table is Partial and out of Range
5. ![](./img/5.%20If%20the%20choice%20of%20table%20is%20partial.png)
# Example inputing start number as 80 and end number as 89

Output: 
![](./img/6.%20output%20for%20a%20partial%20table%20out%20of%20range.png) 

Then another condition
# else statement
Using the c style loop for the partial multiplication table when numbers are within range 

![](./img/7.%20Else%20statement%20for%20an%20approprate%20range%20for%20partial%20table.png)

![](./img/c%20style%20loop%20list%20form.png)
# Then Output:
![](./img/8.%20Ouput%20for%20partial%20within%20range.png)

This is how a 5 times multiplication table was executed on a shell script, with
